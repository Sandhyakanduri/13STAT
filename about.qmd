# Step 1: Load NYC Borough Shapefile
shapefile_path <- "/Users/sandhyakanduri/Desktop/semester 1/ STAT515/final project stat/Borough Boundaries/geo_export_f2f491f7-6347-4598-ad2d-bb86e06c477c.shp"
nyc_boroughs <- st_read(shapefile_path)

# Step 2: Load Arrest Data
file_path <- "/Users/sandhyakanduri/Desktop/semester 1/ STAT515/final project stat/Cleaned_NYPD_Arrest_Data_With_Standardized_Date.csv"
data <- read.csv(file_path)

# Step 3: Map Borough Codes to Full Names
borough_mapping <- c(
  "Q" = "Queens",
  "B" = "Bronx",
  "S" = "Staten Island",
  "M" = "Manhattan",
  "K" = "Brooklyn"
)
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ARREST_BORO_NAME = borough_mapping[ARREST_BORO])

# Step 4: Aggregate Arrest Counts by Borough
borough_counts <- data %>%
  group_by(ARREST_BORO_NAME) %>%
  summarise(Arrest_Count = n())

# Step 5: Prepare Shapefile for Merge
nyc_boroughs <- nyc_boroughs %>%
  mutate(borough = trimws(boro_name))

# Step 6: Merge Arrest Data with Shapefile
nyc_boroughs <- nyc_boroughs %>%
  left_join(borough_counts, by = c("borough" = "ARREST_BORO_NAME"))

# Step 7: Create Choropleth Map with Borough Names
